                <li>When lifting the whisk, the icing should drizzle down and the surface in the bowl should smooth out within 5-10 seconds. If it does not, add more water if it's too thick, or add more confectioners sugar if it's too thin</li>
                <li>You can top the cookies with the icing as-is, or split into small bowls, add food coloring, mix, and then add to a piping bag to decorate</li>
                <ul><li class="note">If you don't have piping bags, a ziplock bag with a small cut made at the corner will also work</li></ul>

This page holds my collection of recipes!
The majority are for baking, but some meals are included in there too

This is mainly a place to consolodate and saving all the random recipes I have handwritten, written in texts, saved from Google, etc.

Each recipe has been rewritten in the way I find helpful, including all the modifications and notes I used when making them

If I got the recipe from somewhere online, I include a reference to the original at the end of each recipe





These recipes include all the modifications and helpful notes I have foudn while making them
I normally rewrite recipes anyways since they often include too much, or too little detail

If I got the recipe from somewhere online, I include a ref
Some have almost no modifications, and others are almost entirely modified



Many of these are not my original recipes, they are from online or from family
I'm just rewiring them in the way that I like, adding my personal notes, and adding my personal modifications for my future reference
