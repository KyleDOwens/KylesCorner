<div class="recipe-title">Coconut Cream Pie</div>
<div class="list-title">Ingredients:</div>
<ul>
    <li>1 & 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li class="note">You can sub out any amount of heavy cream with half-and-half, but it will take longer to thicken up</li>
    <li>1 & 1/2 coconut milk</li>
    <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/3 cup corn starch</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3/4 - 1.5 cup sweetened coconut flakes</li>
    <li>1/4 cup toasted coconut flakes</li>
    <li>1 (9 inch) pie shell</li>
    <li>1 cup whipped cream</li>
</ul>
<div class="list-title">Instructions:</div>
<ul>
    <li>1) Bake the pie crust according to it's instrutions and let it cool to room temp. If you're going to toast coconut flakes for topping, put 1/4 cup coconut flakes onto a baking sheet and bake for 1-3 minutes</li>
    <li class="note">I use premade Pillsbury pie crust</li>
    <li>2) Combine 1 & 1/2 heavy whipping cream, 1 & 1/2 cup coconut milk, 3/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 tsp salt in a medium pot, whisk until combined</li>
    <li>3) Sift in 1/3 cup corn starch to the pot, whisk until combined</li>
    <li>4) Beat the 2 eggs and mix them into the pot, whisk until combined</li>
    <li>5) While whisking constantly, bring to a boil over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens (20-30 minutes)</li>
    <li class="note">Should be rather thick, enough that a clump of it will stay within the whisk when you pick it up</li>
    <li>6) Remove pan from the heat and stir in the 1 tsp vanilla extract and (3/4 - 1.5) cups of non-toasted coconut flakes</li>
    <li>7) Pour custard into the pie shell, then put in fridge to chill until firm (about 4 hrs)</li>
    <li>8) Top with whipped cream, and add desired toppings (non-toasted coconut flakes, toasted coconut flakes, walnuts, etc.)</li>
    <li class="note">PLEASE use homemade whipped cream, it is VERY easy and tastes soooo much better than store-bought, see recipe <a href="" onclick="">here</a></li>
