# Plan
* Website to host all hobby information
    * Restaurant list
    * Album list

* Focus on restaurant list:
    * Have google maps underlay
    * Show list on a sidebar
        * Each entry has genre, visited, notes
        * Be able to highlight specific restaurant on map
    * Have each item correspond to a marker on map
    * Be able to toggle specific restaurants on map
        * Individual or category (genre, visited, etc.)
        * Distance from some point!!!

todo:
* [-] Add coffee shops from google
* [-] Add bakeries from google

* [-] Add ability to normalize colors (all same shade green/blue)

* [+] Add compression/encoding to sharable URL

* [-] Ability to sort table?

* [-] Add non-invasive alert when no time/range is listed for isochrone (maybe just highlight the time input box in red?)

* [-] Pick random restaurant from selected restaurants

* [-] Add isochrone timer (20 per minute)
